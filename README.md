Developed a real-time drowsiness detection system using computer vision, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks (CNN).
This innovative application monitors the user's eye state and triggers an alarm sound when prolonged eye closure is detected, 
helping to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness. By leveraging advanced neural networks for accurate eye-tracking 
and a responsive alarm system, this tool enhances safety for drivers and individuals in high-risk environments.
